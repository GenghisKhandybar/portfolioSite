Transitioning from self/online learned data science enthusiast to formally certified. I've had the initiative to self study topics up through deep learning and implement them myself. Often confused why people say they don't like working with spreadsheets.

My favorite coding languages are Python and R, but happy to work in SAS, C#, C++, Java, and Javascript as well.
